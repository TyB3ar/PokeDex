This is my mini PokeDex! It's a very simple webpage where you can enter in the name of any pokemon, 
and the image/name/abilities/type(s)/base experience will be displayed. 

This page is built with HTML Bootstrap, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. 
Some of the functionalities within the Javascript file include: 
 - Async functions for fetching API data and Displaying fetched data 
 - DOM manipulation for display of data onto webpage 
 - Error handling for User input and Error fetching any data 

Thank you so much, and hope you enjoy!
